Finite Elements Method Algorithms

Codes developed during Finite Elements Methods classes for civil engineering: the cherry cake of mathematical and analytical structural engineering. 

If you are an engineer and don't know what FEM stands for, check this source: https://www5.in.tum.de/lehre/vorlesungen/asc/ss17/fem_asc.pdf from Technische Universität München

Routines in this repo do not include optimization of structural volumes, though I have developed them for sure :) - feel free to contact me in my e-mail if you are interested in them: pedrovgasparotti@gmail.com
